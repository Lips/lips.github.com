	<p>Housing is expensive in general, and very expensive right now. You can find rooms for under 1000, but they&#8217;re not common in neighborhoods where someone coming from out of town is likely to feel comfortable. That&#8217;s not to say they aren&#8217;t safe.</p>

	<p>Craigslist is generally what everyone uses.</p>

	<p>Jersey, Westchester, and long island are all much cheaper than NYC proper. Some locations would require a vehicle, but it is possible to get a place within walking distance of mass transit.<br/>
	There many differences between those options, culture, style, history - but what would be a principal importance is the transit point which connects them to New York City.<br/>
	Jersey is connected to New York by the PATH train which means that locations on Christopher Street 14th and 34th are very accessible.<br/>
	Metro North, coming from West Chester, New Rochelle and a ton of other little towns, stops at Grand Central.<br/>
	The Long Island Railroad feeds into Penn Station. </p>
