	<h1 id="usedbulkfoodbins">Used bulk food bins</h1>

<p>Approximately 46 bins, with wire supports. The supports are screwed into a supporting surface through 4 holes.</p>

<p>This bulk dispensing system was sold by Trade Fixtures, but has been discontinued. The bins are identical to food prep containers available at numerous kitchen supply companies. They&#8217;re made from either Polypropylene or Polyethylene, we don&#8217;t recall, but are BPA-free in either case. Snap fit lids may be available.</p>

<p>Durable replacement lids (that won’t crack) can be made at TnT Plasticland, just south of Canal. 4th Street Food Co-op has templates available for this. The original lid hinges were made from flexible molded plastic, but they&#8217;ve all broken, and replacements are not available. As a replacement, we&#8217;ve used small binder rings (from office supply stores) for over a year. Zip-ties were also tried, but failed on a regular basis.</p>
